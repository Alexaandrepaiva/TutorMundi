# Tutor Mundi Challenge

## About
As one of the challenges of the internship selection process, I was asked to program a one-page website that was faithful to the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/K2DpzKQ9IvPCK1joIYw4Bd/Developer-test?node-id=303%3A189) provided. The choice of programming languages and framework was free and I chose to develop it using Next.js.

## Behavior 
When clicking on any of the stars, it and the stars on the left side of it are filled and the stars on the right side are or remain empty. (For example, if the user clicks on the third star, the first 3 stars are filled and the last 2 are empty.) The "confirm" button is also enabled. In the Figma prototype it is possible to see the simulation of this behavior.

## Evaluation
Fidelity to the layout/behavior of the prototype and code organization will be evaluated.
